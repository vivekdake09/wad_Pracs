âœ… How AJAX Works â€“ Simple Explanation
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique that allows web pages to send and receive data from a server asynchronously, without reloading the page.

ðŸ”„ AJAX Working Process (Step-by-step)
User Event: A user performs an action (e.g., form submission, button click).

JavaScript Creates Request: JavaScript creates an AJAX request using XMLHttpRequest or fetch().

Send to Server: The request is sent to the server (e.g., using POST or GET method).

Server Processes: The server processes the request and sends back a response (usually in JSON or XML format).

JavaScript Handles Response: The JavaScript code receives the response and updates the HTML (DOM) dynamically without reloading the page.


1. What is AJAX?	AJAX allows data to be sent/received asynchronously without reloading the page.
2. What is the difference between POST and GET?	GET fetches data, POST sends data securely.
3. What is localStorage?	A browser-based storage to store data persistently as key-value pairs.
4. How to send data using POST in JS?	Using fetch() or XMLHttpRequest with method POST.
5. Why use JSON.stringify()?	To convert JavaScript objects into JSON strings before storing or sending.
6. What is the use of e.preventDefault()?	Stops the form from submitting the default way (page reload).
7. How do you retrieve data from localStorage?	Using localStorage.getItem("key").
8. How do you redirect to another page in JS?	Using window.location.href = "page.html".
9. Why use addEventListener("submit")?	To handle form submit events using JavaScript.
10. What is the use of headers in fetch()?	To define the data type being sent or received (e.g., JSON).
